[bam_sort] Use -T PREFIX / -o FILE to specify temporary and final output files
Usage: samtools sort [options...] [in.bam]
Options:
  -l INT     Set compression level, from 0 (uncompressed) to 9 (best)
  -u         Output uncompressed data (equivalent to -l 0)
  -m INT     Set maximum memory per thread; suffix K/M/G recognized [768M]
  -M         Use minimiser for clustering unaligned/unplaced reads
  -K INT     Kmer size to use for minimiser [20]
  -n         Sort by read name (not compatible with samtools index command)
  -t TAG     Sort by value of TAG. Uses position as secondary index (or read name if -n is set)
  -o FILE    Write final output to FILE rather than standard output
  -T PREFIX  Write temporary files to PREFIX.nnnn.bam
  --no-PG    do not add a PG line
      --input-fmt-option OPT[=VAL]
               Specify a single input file format option in the form
               of OPTION or OPTION=VALUE
  -O, --output-fmt FORMAT[,OPT[=VAL]]...
               Specify output format (SAM, BAM, CRAM)
      --output-fmt-option OPT[=VAL]
               Specify a single output file format option in the form
               of OPTION or OPTION=VALUE
      --reference FILE
               Reference sequence FASTA FILE [null]
  -@, --threads INT
               Number of additional threads to use [0]
      --write-index
               Automatically index the output files [off]
      --verbosity INT
               Set level of verbosity
